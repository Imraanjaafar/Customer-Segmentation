# Customer-Segmentation

##  Deep learning 

This assessment necessitated  the creation of a deep learning model for forecasting the campaign's results.

## Directory Structure
- Ahmad_Imran_CustomerSegmentation.py

This code implements a transfer learning pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. Let's break down the code into different sections:

### Import Packages

- The necessary libraries are imported, including TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, and others.

### Data Loading

- The code specifies paths for training, validation, and test datasets and sets batch size and image size.
- It loads datasets using tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory for training, validation, and test sets.

### Inspect Data Examples:

- The code visualizes a few examples from the training dataset using Matplotlib.

### Further Split Validation and Test Dataset:

- The validation dataset is split from the test dataset using tf.data.experimental.cardinality.

### Convert Datasets into PrefetchDataset:

- The code converts the TensorFlow datasets into PrefetchDataset for better performance using the prefetch method.

### Create a Sequential Model for Image Augmentation:

- Image augmentation is set up using a Sequential model with random flip and rotation.

### Apply Image Augmentation:

- Image augmentation is applied to a single image from the training dataset, and the results are visualized.

### Define a Layer for Data Normalization:

- A layer for data normalization is defined using MobileNetV2's preprocess_input function.

### Load Pretrained Model and Freeze Feature Extractor:

- The ResNet50 model pretrained on ImageNet is loaded using Keras applications.
- The feature extractor is frozen to retain the pretrained weights.

### Create Model Using Functional API:

- A new model is constructed using the Functional API, incorporating data augmentation, data normalization, feature extraction, and classification layers.

### Compile the Model:

- The model is compiled with an Adam optimizer, sparse categorical crossentropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

### Create TensorBoard Callback:

- A TensorBoard callback is set up for model training visualization.

### Evaluate Model Before Training:

- The model is evaluated on the test dataset before training.

### Model Training:

- The model is trained on the training dataset with early stopping and TensorBoard callbacks.

### Fine-tune the Model:

- The top layers of the pretrained model are unfrozen for fine-tuning.
- The model is compiled again, and fine-tuning is performed.

### Evaluate Model After Fine-tuning:

- The model is evaluated on the test dataset after fine-tuning.

### Deployment:

- A batch of images from the test dataset is used for prediction.
- Predictions and actual labels are visualized using Matplotlib.

### Save the Model:

- The trained model is saved as 'transfer_learning_model.h5'.

## Results
- The model achieved an accuracy of 96.16% on the test set, which demonstrates its effectiveness in classifying concrete images with and without cracks.

## Model Architecture

- The model design utilizes the ResNet50 architecture that includes the layers of the model, the output shape of each layer, and the number of parameters in each layer.
- Presented below is an overview of the model's architecture:
